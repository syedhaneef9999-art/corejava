Interview Question
===================
Q) What is the difference between JDK, JRE and JVM?

JDK 
-----
JDK stands for Java Development Kit.

It is installable software which consist Java Runtime Environment (JRE), Java Virtual Machine (JVM), compiler (javac), interpreter (java), an archiever (.jar), document generator (javadoc) and other tools needed for java application development. (or) jdk cointains set of tools to develop java program.

JRE 
----
JRE stands for Java Runtime Enviroment.
JRE provides very good environment to run java applications only.

JVM
---
JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine.
JVM is an interpreter which is used to execute our program line by line procedure. (OR) jvm will take care of program exeution , memory allocation & de-allocation.

Day 2-

Variable- 
A name which is given to a memory location is called variable.

Purpose of variable is used to store the data.



Datatypes 
=========
Datatype describes what type of value a variable must accept.

Datatype also tells how much memory has to be created for a variable.

1️)Primitive Data Types

Primitive data types are basic, pre-defined data types in Java.
They store simple values and are fast.

Java has 8 primitive types:

byte

short

int

long

float

double

char

boolean

✔ Stored in stack
✔ Fixed size
✔ Store actual value (not reference)

2)Non-Primitive Data Types

Non-primitive types are user-defined or Java-built classes.
They store memory addresses (references).

Examples:

String

Array

Class

Interface

✔ Not fixed size
✔ Created using classes
✔ Store reference/address
✔ More memory usage

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 3
========
Operators:Operator is a symbol which is used to perform some operations on operands.

ex:
	c = a + b; 

	Here = and + are operators. 
	Here a,b and c are operands.
	
1) Assignment Operators

Statement: Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=

Example:

int a = 10;   // assignment
a += 5;       // a = a + 5 → 15
a *= 2;       // a = a * 2 → 30

2) Ternary / Conditional Operator

Statement: Ternary operator is a short form of if–else that returns a value.

Operator: condition ? value1 : value2

Example:

int age = 17;
String result = (age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";

3) Logical Operators

Statement: Logical operators are used to combine multiple boolean conditions.

Operators: &&, ||, !

Example:

boolean a = true, b = false;
System.out.println(a && b); // false
System.out.println(a || b); // true
System.out.println(!a);     // false

4) Bitwise Operators

Statement: Bitwise operators perform operations on binary (bit-level) data.

Operators: &, |, ^, ~

Example:

int a = 5;  // 0101
int b = 3;  // 0011
System.out.println(a & b); // 1  (0001)

5) Arithmetic Operators

Statement: Arithmetic operators perform basic mathematical operations.

Operators: +, -, *, /, %

Example:

int a = 10, b = 3;
System.out.println(a + b); // 13
System.out.println(a % b); // 1

6) Relational Operators

Statement: Relational operators compare two values and return true or false.

Operators: >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=

Example:

int x = 10, y = 20;
System.out.println(x < y);  // true
System.out.println(x == y); // false

7) Shift Operators

Statement: Shift operators move the bits of a number left or right.

Operators: <<, >>, >>>

Example:

int a = 5;        // 0101
System.out.println(a << 1); // 10 (1010)

8) Unary Operators

Statement: Unary operators work on a single operand, mostly used for increment/decrement and negation.

Operators: ++, --, +, -, !

Example:

int a = 5;
System.out.println(++a); // 6 (pre-increment)
System.out.println(a--); // 6 (post-decrement → now 5)

Day 5
====================================================================
Control statements
===================
Control statement enables the programmer to control the flow of the program.

Control statement allows the programmer to make decisions, to jump from one section of code to another section and to execute the code repeatedly.

i) if stmt 
--------------
It is used to execute the source code only if our condition is true.
syntax:
------
	if(condition)
	{
		-
		- //code to be execute 
		-
	}


ii) if else stmt 
=================
It is used to execute the source code either our condition is true or false.

syntax:
-------
	if(condition)
	{
		- //code to be execute if cond is true  
	}
	else
	{	
		- //code to be execute if cond is false 
	}

iii) if else if ladder 
======================
It is used to execute the source code based on multiple conditions.

syntax:
------
	if(cond1)
	{
		- //code to be execute if cond1 is true 
	}
	else if(cond2)
	{
		- //code to be execute if cond2 is true 
	}
	else if(cond3)
	{
		- //code to be execute if cond3 is true 
	}
	else 
	{
		- //code to be execute if all conditions are false	
	}

iv) nested if stmt 
===================
If stmt contains another if stmt is called nested if statement.

syntax:
------
	if(condition)
	{
		if(condition)
		{
			-
			- //code to be execute 
			-	
		}
	}
v) switch case 
===============
It is used to execute the source code based on multiple conditions.

It is similar to if else if ladder.

A switch case is used to read the options from the enduser.

syntax:
------
	switch(condition/expression)
	{
		case  value1:  //code to be execute 
				break stmt;

		case  value2:  //code to be execute 
				break stmt; 
		-
		-
		default :     //code to be execute if all cases are false  
	}
2) Iteration statement
======================
Iteration statement is used to execute the source code for multiple times.

Iteration statement is possible by using loops.

i) do while loop 
----------------
It is used to execute the source code how long our condition is true.

syntax:
------
	do
	{
		-
		- //code to be execute 
		-
	}while(condition);
ii) while loop 
---------------
It is used to execute the source code how long our condition is true.

syntax:
------
	while(condition)
	{
		-
		- //code to be execute 
		-	
	}
iii) for loop 
==============
It is used to execute the source code how long our conditions is true.

syntax:
-------
	for(initialization;condition;increment/decrement)
	{
		-
		- //code to be execute
		-
	}
What is Debugging?

Debugging is the process of finding, understanding, and fixing errors (bugs) in a program.

It allows you to see the program line-by-line, check variable values, and understand why something is not working.
Purpose of Debugging

Debugging is done to:

1️⃣ Identify the exact line where the problem occurs

Example:
Divide by zero, wrong loop condition, null pointer, etc.

2️⃣ Understand how the program flows

You see how your code runs step by step.

3️⃣ Find incorrect logic

Example: wrong conditions, wrong calculations, infinite loops.

4️⃣ Fix errors before the program goes to production

Debugging helps remove bugs early.

5️⃣ Improve program quality and performance

A debugged code behaves more correctly and efficiently.

🛠 Uses of Debugging

Debugging helps you:

✔ Watch variable values

See how values are changing during execution.

✔ Set breakpoints

Stop program at a specific line to inspect data.

✔ Step through code

Step Over → go to next line

Step Into → go inside a method

Step Out → come out of the method

✔ Catch exceptions

Find why your code crashed:

NullPointerException

ArrayIndexOutOfBounds

ArithmeticException

✔ Test logic

Check loops, conditions, operators, and calculations.

✔ Understand program behavior

Beginners learn faster by debugging line-by-line.

Day 6:
=======================================================

The Scanner class in Java is used to take input from the console or command prompt.”

break statement:The break statement is used to stop/exit a loop immediately.

Continue statement:The continue statement skips the current iteration of the loop.

Day 7:
============================
OOPS
====
OOPS stands for Object Oriented Programming System/Structure.

A technology is said to be object oriented if it supports following features.
ex:
	class
	object 
	Abstraction 
	Encapsulation 
	Inheritance and 
	Polymorphism
	
Class:
A class is a blue print of an object.

A class is a collection of objcts.

A class is a logical entity that contains variables and methods.

It is a collection of properties and behaviours.

Object:
It is a outcome of a blue print.

An object is an instance of a class where memory is allocated for the variables.

It is the real-world entity created using the class blueprint.

An object contains the values of properties and performs the behaviours defined inside the class.

Day 8:
==========================================
Methods -> Methods are used to perform some operation / action 
-> In a class we can write any no. of methods including main method

What is Method Declaration? 
Method declaration means we are going to decide what is the name of the method, what 
are the parameters it will take and what kind of value is return by the method.

syntax: returntype methodname(list of parameters);

What is return type?
 return type is data type that indicates what type of value is return by the particular 
method. 
-> return type can be any primitive type or array type or reference type 
-> if method does not return any value, then return type must be specified using a java
keyword called "void"
 
 -> specifying return type is mandatory 

What is method name?
 -> To identify and access the method we should give a suitable name for a method which is 
called as method name. 
-> a method name can be any valid java identifier. 
-> specifying method name is mandatory 

What are method parameters? 
-> parameters are the variables that will receive the values that are passed into the. 
particular method on which data method will perform the operations.
 -> we can write 0 or more number of parameters of any primitive type or array type or 
reference type 
-> specifying parameters is optional. 

Day 9:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
instance variables:
==================
-> Variables which are declared inside the class and outside the method are called as 
instance variables 
-> instance variables can be accessed by all the methods available in the class thats why the 
are called as Global Variables.
 -> Initialization is optional for instance variables 
 > Instance variables are called as Object variables 
 -> When we create the object, then only memory will be allocated for instance variables 
Note: If we create 2 objects, then 2 times memory will be allocated for instance variables
 -> If we don't initialize instance variable, it will be initialized with default value based on 
datatype when the object is created 
-> Every Object will maintain its own copy of the instance variable 

Local Variables:
====================== 
-> The variables which are declared inside the method or constructor or block are called as local variables
-> If we declare a variable with in the method, then that variable can be used / accessed only with in that method 
-> Before using local variables, we have to initialize them 
-> If we create a variable with in the method, memory will be allocated for that variable 
when that method is executing. After that method execution completed, local variable will 
be deleted from memory

Day 10-
============================
A constructor is a special method that is used to initialize an object / instance variables. 
--->If we don't declare a constructor in the class then JVM builds a default constructor for 
that class. This is known as default constructor. 
Rules of the constructor 
• Constructor name must be same as Class Name 
• Constructor cannot take any return type but if we write any return type then the 
code is valid but it is considered as normal method 
• We cannot return any value from the constructor 
• Constructors can take parameters or can be empty
Day 11-
======================================
Static Variables ->
 The variables which are declared inside the class and outside the method with 'static' 
keyword are called as static variables 
-> Static variables are class level variables 
-> When class is loaded into JVM then immediately memory will be allocated for static 
variables
 -> Memory will be allocated for static variables only once when the class is loaded into JVM 
 -> All objects of the class will maintain same copy of the static variables 
 -> Static variables we will access using class name 
 
Q)When to declare variable as static or non-static? 
-> If we want to store different value based on object then use instance variable 
-> If we want to store same value for all objects then use static variable 

Day 11-
=======================================================
 
Polymorphism 
-> Polymorphism means defining one entity with multiple behaviours 
-> In java we have following 2 types of poly morphisms. 
1. Compile time polymorphism 
2. Runtime Polymorphism

 
Compile time Polymorphism: 
If polymorphism is decided at the time of compilation by java compiler, then it is called as compile time polymorphism.
note: By using the concept of method overloading we can achieve this compile time poly 
morphism. 


Method overloading :
---------------------
Method overloading means declaring multiple methods with same method name but having 
different method signature. 
In method overloading while writing the method signature we have to follow following 3 
Rules 
• Method name must be same for all methods 
• List of parameters must be different like different type of parameters, different 
number of parameters, different order of parameters. 
• Return type is not considered in method overloading; it means we never decide 
method overloading with return type 

Day 12
=======================================================
Inheritence:
----------
-> inheritance is the one of most important concepts of OOPS 
-> inheritance means taking the properties of on class into another class
-> The main advantage of inheritance is re usability 
->  To achieve inheritance we will use ‘extends’ keyword 

Day 13
==========================================================
✔ 1. What is Method Overriding?

When a child class writes its own version of a method that already exists in the parent class.

Example:
class Parent {
    void show() { System.out.println("Parent"); }
}
class Child extends Parent {
    void show() { System.out.println("Child"); }
}


👉 Here, show() in child overrides show() in parent.

⭐ 2. Why Do We Override?

To modify parent class logic

To provide different behaviour for child class

To achieve runtime polymorphism (decided at runtime)

⭐ 3. Rules of Overriding (Very Important)
✔ Must have:

Same method name

Same parameters

Same return type (or child type → covariant)

Must be in inheritance

❌ Cannot override:

private methods

static methods (they are hidden, not overridden)

final methods

Constructors

❌ Access modifier cannot reduce

Example:
public → cannot become protected.

⭐ 4. this Keyword (Very Simple)

this = current object

When do we use this?

To access current class variables

To avoid variable shadowing

To call current constructor → this()

Example of shadowing:
class A {
    int x = 10;
    A(int x){
        x = x;      // Wrong → local x assigned to itself
    }
}

⭐ 5. super Keyword

super = parent object

Used for:

Accessing parent variables

Accessing parent methods

Calling parent constructor → super()

Example:
super.x;        // parent variable
super.msg();    // parent method
super();        // parent constructor

⭐ 6. final Keyword
final type	Meaning
final variable	Value cannot change
final method	Cannot be overridden
final class	Cannot be inherited
⭐ 7. Covariant Return Type (Very Easy)

Child method can return a subclass of parent's return type.

Example:
class Parent { Parent test(){} }
class Child extends Parent { Child test(){} } // Allowed

⭐ 8. Static Method Hiding (Not Overriding)
class P { static void m(){} }
class C extends P { static void m(){} }


When you call:

P p = new C();
p.m();  // Parent version runs


👉 Static methods depend on reference type, not object.

⭐ 9. Runtime Polymorphism
Parent p = new Child();
p.show();   // Child version runs


👉 Decided at runtime, not compile time.

⭐ 10. Constructor Overriding?

❌ NOT POSSIBLE.

Constructors are never inherited, so override is impossible.

⭐ 11. Full Example From PDF — Explained
Parent p = new Child();
p.m1();  // Child m1
p.m2();  // Child m2
p.m4();  // Parent static
p.m5();  // Parent final


m1() → overridden → child

m2() → covariant return → child

m4() → static → parent

m5() → final → parent

⭐ 12. Simple Understanding in One Line Each
Overriding →Child changes parent method.

this →Used for current class.

super →Used for parent class.

final →Stops change (method), stops inheritance (class), stops value change (variable).

private →Not inherited → cannot be overridden.

static →Class level → cannot override → only hide.

constructor →Never overridden.


Day 14-
===========================
What is an Abstract Class?

An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated (no object creation) and may contain abstract methods (methods without a body).

👉 It is declared using the keyword abstract.

abstract class ClassName {
    // abstract and non-abstract methods
}


✔ Why do we use an Abstract Class?

Use an abstract class when:

You want common logic + rules

You want to force child classes to implement some methods

You want to use constructors

You want partial abstraction (not 100% like interface)

You want to keep state (variables)

Q)Definition of Abstraction

👉 Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details and showing only essential features to the user.

Day 15-
=========================
Interface:
-> An interface is a fully abstract class. It includes a group of abstract methods (methods 
without a body). 
-> We use the interface keyword to create an interface in Java. 

Day-16---
===========================
Encapsulation in Java
✔ Definition

Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data (variables) and methods into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to data.
Encapsulation is the process of hiding data and allowing access through methods.
👉 Achieved using private variables + public getters & setters.
